# Horiseon Marketing Webpage

## Description

The Horiseon Marketing Webpage was originally missing some accessibiltiy atributes which are not only desired in society today but are needed so everyone has the same access to information and services.

Working on this code file was a great experience for me to be able to tinker with code and see what is what while also learning to create a more accessible webpage. Not only for this webpage but to add accessibility artibutes to all future projects.

## Code Edits to Index.html

<ul>
<li> Changed all //div// to semantic in logical order </li>
<li> Updated website title to more consise and descriptive title </li>
<li> Added accessibility discription of search-engine-optimization </li>
<li> Added accessability description for online-reputation-management.jpg </li>
<li> Added accessibility description for social-media-marketing.jpg </li>
<li> Added accessibility description for lead-generation.png </li>
<li> Added accessibility description for brand-awareness.png </li>
<li> Added accessibility description for cost-management.png </li>
<li> Changed benifit-lead to lines 79 and 89 to streamline code is style.css </li>
</ul>

## Code Edits to Style.css

<ul>
<li> Changed all //.header div// to //.header nav// to represent navigation bar. Changed style.css header from //div// to //nav// so css would match </li>
<li> Back-ground image doesn't add any content or extra information relative to webpage, Leaving //alt=>// description out to create less "busy" page for screen readers </li>
<li> //div// class is changed in index.html from benefit-brand, and cost to all resemble benefit-lead as they're identical. </li>
<li> struggled with creating a semantic in index.html, however, seperating with <,> in style.css works to consolidate code </li>
</ul>
