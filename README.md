# Horiseon Marketing Webpage

## Description

The Horiseon Marketing Webpage was originally missing some accessibiltiy atributes which are not only desired in society today but are needed so everyone has the same access to information.

Working on this code file was a great experience for me to be able to tinker with code and see what is what while also learning to create a more accessible webpage. Not only for this webpage but to add accessibility artibutes to all future projects.
